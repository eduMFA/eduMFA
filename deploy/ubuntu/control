Description: two-factor authentication system e.g. for OTP devices
 eduMFA: identity, multifactor authentication, authorization.
 This package contains the python module for eduMFA. If you want
 to run it in a productive webserver you might want to install
 edumfa-nginx or edumfa-apache2.
 eduMFA is an open solution for strong two-factor authentication.
 eduMFA aims to not bind you to any decision of the authentication protocol
 or it does not dictate you where your user information should be stored.
 This is achieved by its totally modular architecture.
 eduMFA is not only open as far as its modular architecture is concerned.
 But eduMFA is completely licensed under the AGPLv3.
