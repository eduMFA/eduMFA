    The :ref:`push_token` uses the Firebase service to send challenges to the
    user's smartphone. The user confirms on the smartphone, signs the
    challenge and sends it back to eduMFA.

    The enrollment occurs in two enrollment steps:

    **Step 1**:
      The device is enrolled using a QR code, which encodes the following URI::

          otpauth://pipush/PIPU0006EF85?url=https://youredumfaserver/enroll/this/token&ttl=120

    **Step 2**:
      In the QR code is a URL, where the smartphone sends the remaining data for the enrollment:

        .. sourcecode:: http

            POST /ttype/push HTTP/1.1
            Host: https://youredumfaserver/

            serial=<token serial>
            fbtoken=<Firebase token>
            pubkey=<public key>
