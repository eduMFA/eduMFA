TOTP
----

The TOTP token is - together with the :ref:`hotp_token` - the most common token.
The TOTP Algorithm is defined in
`RFC6238 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238>`_.
The TOTP token is a time based token.
Roughly speaking the TOTP algorithm is the same algorithm like the HOTP,
where the event based counter is replaced by the unix timestamp.

The TOTP algorithm has some parameter, like if the generated OTP value will
be 6 digits or 8 digits or if the SHA1 or the SHA256 hashing algorithm is
used and the timestep being 30 or 60 seconds.

The TOTP token implements the :ref:`authenticate mode <authentication_mode_authenticate>`.
With a suitable :ref:`policy_challenge_response` policy, it may also be used
in the :ref:`challenge mode <authentication_mode_challenge>`.

Hardware tokens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The information about preseeded token and seedable tokens is the same as
described in the section about :ref:`hotp_token`.

The only available seedable pushbutton TOTP token is the *SafeNet eToken Pass*.
The Yubikey can be used as a TOTP token, but only in conjunction with a
smartphone app, since the Yubikey does not have an internal clock.

Software tokens
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Experiences
...........

The Google Authenticator and the FreeOTP token can be enrolled easily in
TOTP mode using the QR-Code enrollment Feature.

The Google Authenticator is available for iOS, Android and Blackberry devices.

Enrollment
~~~~~~~~~~

Default settings for TOTP tokens can be configured at :ref:`totp_token_config`.

The enrollment is the same as described in :ref:`hotp_token`.
However, when enrolling TOTP token, you can specify some additional parameters.
