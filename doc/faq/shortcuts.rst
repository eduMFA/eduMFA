Are there shortcuts to use the Web UI?

.. index:: shortcuts, hotkeys

I do not like using the mouse. Are there hotkeys or shortcuts to use the Web UI?

You can use ``?`` to get a list of the available hotkeys in the current window.

E.g. you can use ``alt-e`` to go to the *Enroll Token* Dialog and ``alt-r`` to
actually enroll the token.

For any further ideas about shortcuts/hotkeys please drop us a note at
