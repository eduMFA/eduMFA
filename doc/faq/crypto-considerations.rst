Cryptographic considerations of eduMFA
-------------------------------------------

.. index:: Crypto considerations

Encryption keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The encryption key is a set of 3 256bit AES keys. Usually this key is located
in a 96 byte long file "enckey" specified by *EDUMFA_ENCFILE* in :ref:`cfgfile`.
The encryption key can be encrypted with a password.

The three encryption keys are used to encrypt

* data like the OTP seeds and secret keys stored in the *Token* table,
* password of resolvers to connect to LDAP/AD or SQL (stored in the
  *ResolverConfig* table)
* and optional additional values.

OTP seeds and passwords are needed in clear text to calculate OTP values or
to connect to user stores. So these values need to be stored in a decryptable
way.

Token Hash Algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OTP values according to HOTP and TOTP can be calculated using SHA1, SHA2-256
and SHA2-512.

.. _faq_crypto_pin_hashing:

PIN Hashing
~~~~~~~~~~~

Token PINs are managed by eduMFA as the first of the two factors. Each
token has its own token PIN. The token PIN is hashed with Argon2 (9 rounds)
and stored in the *Token* database table.

This PIN hashing is performed in *lib.crypto:hash*.

Administrator Passwords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

eduMFA can manage internal administrators using :ref:`edumfa-manage`.
Internal administrators are stored in the database table *Admin*.

The password is stored using Argon2 (9 rounds) with an additional pepper.
While Argon2 uses a salt which is stored in the *Admin* table
created randomly for each admin password the pepper is unique for one
eduMFA installation and stored in the edumfa.cfg file.

This way a database administrator is not able to inject rogue password hashes.

The admin password hashing is performed in *lib.crypto:hash_with_pepper*.

.. _faq_crypto_audit:

Audit Signing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The audit log is digitally signed. (see :ref:`audit` and :ref:`audit_parameters`).

The audit log can be handled by different modules. eduMFA comes with an
SQL Audit Module which is enabled by default.

For signing the audit log the SQL Audit Module uses the RSA keys specified
with the values ``EDUMFA_AUDIT_KEY_PUBLIC`` and ``EDUMFA_AUDIT_KEY_PRIVATE`` in
:ref:`cfgfile`.

By default the installer generates 2048bit RSA keys.

If you can assure that the private key has not been tampered with, the config
entry ``EDUMFA_AUDIT_NO_PRIVATE_KEY_CHECK = True`` avoids a time-consuming check during
loading of the private key (See also :ref:`faq_perf_crypto_audit`).

The audit signing is performed in *lib.crypto:Sign.sign* using SHA2-256 as
hash function.
