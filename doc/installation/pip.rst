Python Package Index
--------------------

.. index:: pip install, virtual environment

You can install eduMFA usually on any Linux distribution in a python
virtual environment. This way you keep all eduMFA code in one defined
subdirectory.

eduMFA currently runs with Python 3.6 to 3.10. Other
versions either do not work or are not tested.

You first need to install a package for creating a python `virtual environment
<https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_.

Now you can setup the virtual environment for eduMFA like this::

  virtualenv /opt/eduMFA

  cd /opt/eduMFA
  source bin/activate

.. note::
    Some distributions still ship Python 2.7 as the system python. If you want
    to use Python 3 you can create the virtual environment like this:
    `virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 /opt/eduMFA`

Now you are within the python virtual environment and you can run::

  pip install eduMFA

in order to install the latest eduMFA version from
`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/eduMFA>`_.

Deterministic Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The eduMFA package contains dependencies with a minimal required version. However, newest
versions of dependencies are not always tested and might cause problems.
If you want to achieve a deterministic installation, you can now install the pinned and tested
versions of the dependencies::

  pip install -r lib/edumfa/requirements.txt

It would even be safer to install the pinned dependencies *before* installing eduMFA.
So if you e.g. know that you are going to install version 1.2.0 you can run::

    pip install -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eduMFA/eduMFA/v1.2.0/requirements.txt
    pip install edumfa==1.2.0

Configuration
.............

Database
^^^^^^^^

eduMFA makes use of `SQLAlchemy <https://www.sqlalchemy.org>`_ to be able
to talk to different SQL-based databases. Our best experience is with
`MySQL <https://www.mysql.com/>`_ but SQLAlchemy supports many different
databases [#sqlaDialects]_.

The database server should be installed on the host or be otherwise reachable.

In order for eduMFA to use the database, a database user with the
appropriate privileges is needed.
The following SQL commands will create the database as well as a user in `MySQL`::

    CREATE DATABASE pi;
    CREATE USER "pi"@"localhost" IDENTIFIED BY "<dbsecret>";
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON pi.* TO "pi"@"localhost";

You must then add the database name, user and password to your `edumfa.cfg`. See
:ref:`cfgfile` for more information on the configuration.

Setting up eduMFA
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Additionally to the database connection a new ``EDUMFA_PEPPER`` and ``SECRET_KEY``
must be generated in order to secure the installation::

    PEPPER="$(tr -dc A-Za-z0-9_ </dev/urandom | head -c24)"
    echo "EDUMFA_PEPPER = '$PEPPER'" >> /path/to/edumfa.cfg
    SECRET="$(tr -dc A-Za-z0-9_ </dev/urandom | head -c24)"
    echo "SECRET_KEY = '$SECRET'" >> /path/to/edumfa.cfg

An encryption key for encrypting the secrets in the database and a key for
signing the :ref:`audit` log is also needed (the following commands should be
executed inside the virtual environment)::

    edumfa-manage create_enckey  # encryption key for the database
    edumfa-manage create_audit_keys  # key for verification of audit log entries

To create the database tables execute::

    edumfa-manage create_tables

Stamping the database to the current database schema version is important for
the update process later::

    edumfa-manage db stamp head -d /opt/edumfa/lib/edumfa/migrations/

After creating a local administrative user with::

    edumfa-manage admin add <login>

the development server can be started with::

    edumfa-manage runserver

.. warning::
    The development server should not be used for a productive environment.

Webserver
^^^^^^^^^

To serve authentication requests and provide the management UI a
`WSGI <https://wsgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ capable webserver
like `Apache2 <https://httpd.apache.org/>`_ or `nginx <https://nginx.org/en>`_
is needed.

Setup and configuration of a webserver can be a complex procedure depending on
several parameter (host OS, SSL, internal network structure, ...).
Some example configuration can be found in the NetKnights GitHub
repositories [#nkgh]_. More on the WSGI setup for eduMFA can be found in
:ref:`wsgiscript`.
