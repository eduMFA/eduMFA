.. _user_registration:

User registration
.................

Users are allowed to register with eduMFA.
I.e. a user that does not exist in a given realm and resolver can create a
new account.

.. note:: Registering new users is only possible, if there is a writeable
   resolver and if the necessary policy in the scope *register* is defined.
   For editable UserIdResolvers see :ref:`useridresolvers`.

If a register policy is defined, the login window of the Web UI gets a new
link "Register".

   *Next to the login button is a new link 'register', so that new users are
   able to register.*

A user who clicks the link to register a new account gets this registration
dialog:

   *Registration form*

During registration the user is also enrolled :ref:`registration_token` token. This
registration code is sent to the user via a notification email.

.. note:: Thus - using the right policies in scope *webui* and
   *authentication* - the user could login with the password he set during
   registration an the registration code he received via email.


Policy settings
...............

In the scope *register* several settings define the behaviour of the
registration process.

   *Creating a new registration policy*

realm
~~~~~

type: string

This is the realm, in which a new user will be registered. If this realm is
not specified, the user will be registered in the default realm.

resolver
~~~~~~~~

type: string

This is the resolver, in which the new user will be registered. If this
resolver is not specified, **registration is not possible!**

.. note:: This resolver must be an editable resolver, otherwise the user can
   not be created in this resolver.

smtpconfig
~~~~~~~~~~

type: string

This is the unique identifier of the :ref:`smtpserver`. This SMTP server is
used to send the notification email with the registration code during the
registration process.

.. note:: If there is no *smtpconfig* or set to a wrong identifier, the user
   will get no notification email.

.. _policy_requiredemail:

requiredemail
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: string

This is a regular expression according to [#pythonre]_.

Only email addresses matching this regular expression are allowed to register.

**Example**: If you want to authenticate the user only by the OTP value, no
matter what OTP PIN he enters, a policy might look like this::

   action: requiredemail=/.*@mydomain\..*/

This will allow all email addresses from the domains *mydomain.com*,
*mydomain.net*
etc...

registration_body
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

type: str

The body of the registration email. Use the ``{regkey}`` as tag for the
registration key.
